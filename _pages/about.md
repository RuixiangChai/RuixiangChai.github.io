I am currently a Computer Science major Ph.D. student at Northwestern University, McCormick School of Engineering. I am advised by <a href='https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html'>Prof. Han Liu</a> and I conduct research at Modern Artificial General Intelligence and Computer Systems Lab (MAGICS Lab). My focus of research is **Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Analysis** through a variety of machine learning methods. I am currently working on financial time series prediciton through **Cross-Sectional Regression**. 

I have finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the University of Waterloo in Canada in 2022. I have finished multiple internships in areas ranging from system development, autonomous vehicle, and machine learning research.

Besides research, I find my interests in sports, travelling, and photography. I played badminton competitively in high school. In addition, I like watching variety of sports ranging from soccer, basketbal to Formula one, to mixed martial arts. I love travling around the world during holidays and taking both landscape and street photography.
